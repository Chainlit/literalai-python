# Literal AI API

This module contains the APIs to directly interact with the Literal AI platform.

`BaseLiteralAPI` has all the methods prototypes and is the source of truth when it comes to documentation.

Inheriting from `BaseLiteralAPI` are `LiteralAPI` and `AsyncLiteralAPI`, the synchronous and asynchronous APIs respectively.
